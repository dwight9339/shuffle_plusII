# Shuffle+
A handy Spotify playlist shuffling utility! Provides three main shuffle modes and advanced shuffling options.

*Note: You must have a Spotify Premium subscription to use this service*

### Shuffle Modes
##### Random
Shuffles tracks in a playlist uniformly randomly. This is the way that many music shuffling algorithms used to work but users complained that they didn't like that they could end up listening to several songs by the same artist in a row and wanted a more homogenous mix from their playlist.
##### Spread
Enter the "spread shuffle". This shuffling algorithm is based on the ones now used by many music services. It provides random playback of tracks in a playlist but also ensures that tracks by the same artist or from the same album are as spread out from one another as possible; providing a playback experience that is random but not *too* random.
##### Biased
Biased shuffle allows you to choose artists, albums, or even individual tracks from your playlist that you would like to appear closer to the top of the playlist than others. Choosing this mode provides you with a list of options for adding weights to the tracks in your playlist. Tracks with a higher weight are more likely to appear closer to the top of the list.

### Shuffle Options
In addition to spreading or weighting tracks based on their artist, **Shuffle+** also allows you to spread or weight tracks based on the album they appear on.
